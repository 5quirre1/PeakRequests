# PeakRequests lib

i hate how you do requests in c# because i mainly code in python.  
python has **SUPER** simple syntax for doing requests (mostly because python is **SUPER** easy)  
and i want to keep that same lazy feeling when doing requests in c#.  

so uh it's based off the python requests module!!!  

also i'm still KINDA new at c# so don't expect it to be godly **LMFAO**  
so yea peak
